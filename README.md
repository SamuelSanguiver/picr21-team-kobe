Don't merge with the main branch until you have your features working, otherwise use an alternative branch e.g "prototype" or make your own to first test and develop your feature.
To use vnc you first have to connect to the robot via ssh and the ip is computer@192.168.3.63
and then to start vnc open terminal and type vncserver and then open your vnc client and connect to the ip:5902.
